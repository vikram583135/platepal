# PlatePal Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the complete development plan for "PlatePal," a full-stack food delivery application. The project is built using a modern microservices architecture and encompasses four distinct interfaces: a Customer Mobile App, a Restaurant Partner Dashboard, a Delivery Partner App, and an Admin Panel.

## Phase 0: Foundation & Setup

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Objective:** Establish a professional and scalable development environment.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   Installed and configured all core development tools: VS Code, Git, Node.js, Docker.
*   Set up a monorepo structure under Git version control on GitHub.
*   Established a containerized development environment for PostgreSQL and MongoDB using Docker Compose.

## Phase 1: Backend Core - User Authentication Service

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Objective:** Build the foundational microservice responsible for user identity, registration, and secure login.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   Created the `user-service` using the NestJS framework.
*   Successfully connected the service to the PostgreSQL database.
*   Implemented a secure `/auth/register` endpoint with password hashing (bcryptjs).
*   Implemented a secure `/auth/login` endpoint that issues JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for stateless authentication.
*   Thoroughly tested all endpoints for success, conflict, and validation errors using Postman.

## Phase 2: Frontend - Restaurant Partner Dashboard (UI & Auth)

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Objective:** Build the user-facing web application for restaurant partners, including a functional login system and protected pages.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   Initialized a Next.js project (`restaurant-dashboard`) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
*   Built a fully functional login page that successfully communicates with the `user-service` backend.
*   Implemented client-side logic to store the JWT in localStorage upon successful login.
*   Created a reusable Higher-Order Component (`withAuth`) to protect sensitive routes from unauthorized access.
*   Built the static UI skeletons for the "Menu Management" and "Order Management" pages.
*   Implemented a complete and functional UI for the dashboard, menu management, and order management.

## Phase 3: Backend Core - Restaurant & Order Services

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Objective:** Build the services that manage core business logic (restaurants, menus, orders) and connect the frontend dashboard to live data.

### `restaurant-service`

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   Scaffolded the `restaurant-service` and connected it to both PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
*   Created the data models (Restaurant entity, Menu schema).
*   Built and tested the public endpoints (`GET /restaurants`, `GET /restaurants/:id/menu`).
*   Implemented JWT Security to validate incoming JWTs.
*   Built Protected Menu Update Endpoint (`PUT /restaurants/:id/menu`).
*   Built a complete CRUD API for menus.

### `order-service`

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   Scaffolded the `order-service` NestJS project.
*   Connected it to the PostgreSQL database and created the Order entity.
*   Integrated Socket.IO by creating a WebSocket Gateway (`OrdersGateway`).
*   Built the `POST /orders` endpoint.
*   Implemented a mechanism to emit a `new_order` event using the gateway after saving an order to the database.

## Phase 4: Frontend - Customer Mobile App (React Native)

**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Objective:** Build the primary mobile application for end-users.

### UI/UX Design Plan

1.  **Wireframing & Prototyping:** Create low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity interactive prototypes for all screens to define the layout, user flow, and overall user experience.
2.  **UI Kit:** Design a
 comprehensive UI kit with a consistent color palette, typography, and reusable components to ensure a consistent and polished look and feel.

### Step-by-step Implementation Plan

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Initialize a new React Native project (`CustomerApp`) and configure React Navigation.
    *   Set up the project structure with `screens`, `components`, `navigation`, `services`, and `state` directories.
2.  **Authentication Screens:**
    *   Build the UI and logic for the Login and Register screens, connecting them to the `user-service`.
    *   Implement secure token storage on the device.
3.  **Core Screens:**
    *   Build a `HomeScreen` that fetches and displays a list of restaurants from `GET /restaurants`.
    *   Build a `MenuScreen` that fetches and displays a specific menu from `GET /restaurants/:id/menu`.
4.  **Cart & Checkout:**
    *   Implement a global state management solution (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit) for the 
    
    g cart.
    *   Build the UI for the cart and checkout process.
    *   Connect the "Place Order" button to the `POST /orders` endpoint on the `order-service`.
5.  **Real-time Order Tracking:**
    *   Implement a real-time order tracking screen that connects to the `order-service` via WebSockets to display the order status.

## Phase 5: Supporting Interfaces

**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Objective:** Build the remaining two applications for delivery partners and administrators.

### Delivery Partner App (React Native)

1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize a new React Native project.
2.  **Authentication:** Implement login functionality for delivery partners.
3.  **Real-time Tasks:** Build a simple UI that connects to the `order-service` via WebSockets to listen for `delivery_task` events.
4.  **Task Management:** Implement "Accept"/"Reject" functionality for delivery tasks.

 ment user management features.

## Phase 6: Deployment & Finalization

**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Objective:** Deploy the entire application to the cloud.

**Steps:**

1.  **Containerize Backend:** Finalize the `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all backend services.
2.  **Deploy Backend:** Deploy the containerized services to a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
3.  **Deploy Frontend:** Deploy the Next.js web dashboards to a hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Recommended):** Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the testing and deployment process.
5.  **Publish Mobile Apps:** Publish the `CustomerApp` and `DeliveryApp` to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## Phase 7: UI/UX Polish and Refinement

**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Objective:** Enhance the overall user experience and visual appeal of all applications.

**Steps:**

1.  **Design System:** Create a unified design system to ensure consistency across all applications.
2.  **Component Library:** Build a reusable component library based on the design system.
3.  **UI/UX Review:** Conduct a thorough UI/UX review of all applications to identify and address any usability issues.
4.  **Accessibility:** Ensure all applications are accessible to users with disabilities.
5.  **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the performance of all applications to ensure a fast and responsive user experience.
